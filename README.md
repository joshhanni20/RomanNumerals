# RomanNumerals
This code can convert from roman numerals to modern numbers and vice versa.

I spent 3 hours and 15 minutes getting the whole project figured out, and then I spent about thirty minutes cleaning up the code to make it readable!

For Roman Numerals that the user inputs incorrectly, I just have the program output that it cannot be converted.

I also designed it to run as a user inputting inputs in a window that opens as you compile!
